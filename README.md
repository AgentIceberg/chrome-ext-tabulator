# Tabs Should Rest

[![Gratipay (Gittip) for Greduan](http://img.shields.io/gratipay/Greduan.svg)](https://gratipay.com/Greduan/)

Like OneTab but leaner and FOSS.  Named "Tabs Should Rest", final name pending.

It started out with the idea of being a OneTab clone where I would release the
source code but immediately I found stuff I could do better and lighter than
OneTab.  For example OneTab runs constantly, while this runs only when it's
called or the tab groups page is displayed.  (Event pages [this] vs. persistent
background page [OneTab].)

Currently it is useable but still in development, stuff might break and the
useable parts are only core parts, the interface is still very
crude/non-existent.

I am not yet going to provide usage or installation instructions as this is not
yet ready for use, and at this point if you want to use it you really should be
the kind of user who knows how to do this already. :)
