Like OneTab but leaner and FOSS.  Named "Tabs Should Rest", final name pending.

It started out with the idea of being a OneTab clone where I would release the
source code but immediately I found stuff I could do better and lighter with
OneTab.  For example OneTab runs constantly, while this runs only when it's
called or the suspended tabs page is displayed.  (Event pages [this] vs.
persistent background page [OneTab].)

Currently it is useable but still in development, stuff might break and the
useable parts are only core parts, the interface is still very
crude/non-existent.
