# News (Changelog for users)

All changes that would affect users will be listed in this file.

## 0.3.0-alpha - 2014-11-17

This version provides a nice looking interface to the saved tab groups.

Pretty near to the full release now.  Some kinks still have to be figured out
and refactoring is still to come.

## 0.2.0-alpha - 2014-11-17

Implemented an MVC interface using Mithril.js.  Spent all yesterday studying and
figuring out what MVCs are, how Mithril.js fits into the whole scene etc.
Really cool project.

Anyway the changes are basically.  Now you can remove tabs or groups of tabs by
clicking the X to the left of the group/tab.

## 0.1.0-alpha - 2014-11-01

It has the basics in.  You can put tabs to rest with the click of a button, that
opens a tab with the list of tab groups.  These tab groups cannot be modified
yet through a nice interface.  To edit them you have to go into the JS console
and run some commands to modify the localStorage.

not yet ready for daily usage but it's getting there.
